# nginxChain
Proof of concept for chained reverse proxies and X-Forwarded-For dealing.

There are two branches:
https://github.com/YusDyr/nginxChain/tree/main - done with Lua
https://github.com/YusDyr/nginxChain/tree/nginx-frontend - done with Nginx's `map` feature

It removes any `X-Forwarded-For` header if it set without `X-Nginx-Proxy` header - what means it was spoofed (provided by an user).

Check:
`docker compose up`
and then
```shell
 for i in {1..10}; do echo "Connection #$i"; curl -sH "X-Forwarded-For: 8.8.8.8"  http://localhost:80/nginx_forwards; done
```

Result:
```shell
